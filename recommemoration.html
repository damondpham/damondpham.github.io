			<p>- Clothing waste is an environmental catastrophe. You know that already.</p>
			<p>- See work from <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://theor.org/">The Or Foundation</a>, especially this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://deadwhitemansclothes.org/">website</a> and this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stopwastecolonialism.org/">call to action</a>.</p>
			<p>- Although excessive clothing production is the fundamental issue, thrifting helps.</p>
			<p>- Fashion is subjective, but some kinds of used clothes are super unpopular.</p>
			<p>- If the game of upcycling is to renew desirability, this is an attempt to score.</p>
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/A1.png" alt="Four graphic t-shirts hang from a cable indoors. Sewn lime-green fabric covers almost all of the graphics, save for the dates.">
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/A2.png" alt="A close-up of one of the shirts. It's yellow. The lime-green fabric covers 80% of some blue text, and the bottom 20% appears to say 'BOUNTIFUL'.">
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/A3.png" alt="Damon models the yellow shirt. He sits on a stool, wears a hat and is drinking from a mug. There's some motion blur.">
			<br><br><br>
			<p>- Commemorative tees are widely skipped over at the thrift store, I think.</p>
			<p>- Who wants to rep a school's annual bake-a-thon? How about a corporate 5K?</p>
			<p>- Well, me, kind of. It's playful or something; I have a sick sense of humor :)</p>
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/B1.png" alt="Damon models the black shirt. His back is turned to the camera; the top of the shirt says '26.Nov.2011' with blocks of lime-green fabric above and below.">
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/B2.png" alt="Two vertical strips of lime-green fabric cover the back of a green shirt. Corporate logos peek through the gap, but are illegible due to the small width.">
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/B3.png" alt="A bit of a still-life featuring several shirts hung or draped on a chair. A blue fan has been placed at the side.">
			<br><br><br>
			<p>- The date hints the shirt's commemorative function; nearly all else is omitted.</p>
			<p>- From hyperspecific to pluripotent. A day is lifted and relived. Hurrah!</p>
			<p>- The next owner of the shirt can create new meaning, new sentimentality.</p> 
			<p>- But also: green screens are themselves material. Nothing is negative.</p>
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/C1.png" alt="Close-up of a stack of folded shirts; the folded edge of the yellow shirt with the date is showing (the month is cropped out, but it's the fifteenth of some month in 2001).">
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/C2.png" alt="The black tee is hung from a mic stand against a plain white background.">
			<img src="stuff/recommemoration/C3.png" alt="The green tee is hung with the yellow tee behind it.">
			<br><br><br>
			<p>- Go on, steal this idea.</p>
			<p>- We must cut down the bloated rate of mass, few-use clothing production.</p>
			<p>- I hope the spirit of these tees builds momentum toward doing so.</p>
