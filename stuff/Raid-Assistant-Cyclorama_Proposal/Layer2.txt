	cuts cucumber with excess dishware
	so as to have more to do after.

Nenji hates a midday bright. 

Nenji draws money
	from a bank of drying currency.

Nenji makes collage of magazines
	in a remains of a morning’s
	leave for work routine.
	He does this in the bed shared
		since smell stays most. 
			Yes, it is reminding now...

Nenji didn't see when
	he fell asleep. 
	A video is calling.

Hey his heartbeat says.
Hey his heart's desire says. 

More faces.

A question about a decision about Noa. 

A demurral and then its puncture. 

An "Okay listen" then
	a "So my cousin's girlfriend's
		ex-half-neighbor's
			pet's hairstylist's
				twin
		is on Moviestar Tower-Mall's Board of Execs,
		has an after-hours code meant for the theater,
		has an office on the second-highest floor,
		has a tier of GPUs robbing its electric energy
			in secret. Nearby, it must be there:
			a USB wallet soaked in crypto money,
	so I have heard.

An "Okay so".

A "My friend Camille. She's clever."

An "Okay so".

A "Well, have you heard of this
	thing, a heist?"
