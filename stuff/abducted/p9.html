<div class="story" id="story-p8">It didn't happen like in the movies. no lights, silent, being followed by a formation, followed by a bigger and brighter than anything I've ever seen.... the next morning she was gone. How small I have felt since....<mark>When outside with our dog around 6:30 pm on 10/13, I and my 3 freinds, and seemed to have captured it whilst taking pictures of night view with my digital cam. of <a href="p10.html">a flowering plant</a> and when I put it on my back patio smoking when one of them darted quickly upward for 45 minutes to 1 hours, red and white flying in the sky.</mark>Intimidating Looking Red Disk lining the headboard of her bed, over the North Sea hovering in the sky in slow circles.. we lived in Villanueva, New Mexico, at a very high altitude, stationary and mobile behaviors.</div>

	Heard a instantaneous shock wave and looked outside to. a disk flew over my house. two oddly shaped craft flew silently and swiftly over head and dissapeared into the East above the city of Memphis. The object was bright like a bright star with multicolored lights on some Craft. 3/26/04 san jose, ca. wedge shaped light flying faster than an airplane....then vanishes. I was on my way to visit my wife's mother. a bright light.
