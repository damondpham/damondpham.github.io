
Shinya & Nenji live in a thrill 
	Diamond Hill contract
	with couch place & opera
		books on a shelf
			tonight.

There you are, Shinya now lets out. 
He goes to Nenji’s frame at a shelf.

Nenji puts a bookmark and then puts a book. 
He lets in Shinya from coffee table region.

Shinya sets the briefcase down 
	so as to have his arms around Noa’s sweater
	which is around Nenji. Shinya “trains his gaze.”

Nenji feels a back of a sweater touch 
	the lanyard with the encased key card
	belonging to Shinya. Nenji “blushes inwardly.”

A pleasant mood is coming through.

Later, Shinya smokes and reads a paper. 
	His fingers strum a TV remote. 

Nenji yawns and wipes silverware. 
	He perches by the window of Shinya’s ear. 

There is a series of woodwind instruments held upright 
	and in ascending height by a wire stand. 
	There is a vertical scroll taped beside a clock. 

Harsh pulses shimmer a home’s inside.

Children play in a yard overseen by a hope muscle. 

On Sunday, Noa returns. 

Blood sings on a breeze. Expressions play on faces.

Nenji will "erase" and Shinya will "leave no trace."

Fuzz and dampened red motion along a plane. 





Shinya
	works with Akiya in a state
	of expression		(they are 
	visual director 
	plus assistant).

Akiya makes diagonal no’s 
	on drafts from edge 
	to edge.

Shinya after packing tea pods 
	in neat displays
	answers emails from toilet stall
	and at mirror glares himself down
		“in an abyss of insufficient
			self-consolation.”

		Tuesdays are for 
			fourth floor lunch
			he tuna sandwiches 
			and stairs.

		In the parking lot, a classics CD
			and wondering of Nenji
				beautiful hymn
					testimony 
					on lended terrace.
				
For seasons, he has not seen himself
	by himself.





Shinya
	is a motion repeater
	and alignment
	checker
	and generally has been recognized
		for his careful eye
			not inventive not extraordinary
			Akiya likes extraordinary 

Shinya submits documents
	with letterheads
	"on behalf."

In the remaining hour, Shinya
	submits the week
	evaluation
	of his help. 



Shinya 
	as sardine
	on the metro back 
	to not home
	but his place.



Tamago 
	greets Shinya
	who pets her and sets meals
	for them both
	she relaxes 

Shinya showers for video call. 
	Then he rings him.
