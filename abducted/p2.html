Of course, that did nothing to console me. I immediately reported the incident to the police, but they refused to entertain the idea that aliens had visited us. So I took initiative and began researching myself. I became a frequent presence on theblackvault.com and other alien sightings forums. I never spoke about what happened to my daughter due to concern for my own privacy, but I followed each major report, trying to tease out the patterns or trends that might explain where she was taken.

I even flew to an extraterrestrial convention in Hawaii. In my purse I packed a portfolio of materials on alien abductions similar to my daughter's, hoping to find someone to discuss them with. I was severely disappointed: the other attendees were more keen on purchasing T-shirts than working out theories. I tried to clear my mind by visiting the beach, but found it infested with jellyfish. The whole incident made me feel horribly sick and I left the convention <a href="p3.html">early</a>.
