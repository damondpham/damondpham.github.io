	<b>	Neopets.com and a Trip to Fry’s Electronics </b>
	<br>
	<br>I am eight but I say I'm eighteen, mostly so I can browse the forums although I don't chat with anyone.
	<br>(Mom hasn’t been around to check this, but still, I don’t want to be spontaneously murdered or something.)
	<br>By 9 AM my breath is Lucky Charms. I'm a hamster-ball, obsessed with smiley eggs but the red ones kill me.
	<br>I'm a sly crocodile, in love with auto-generated pirate coins but hordes of shuriken hone in on my boat.
	<br>I complete these and similar rituals 3x each to make about 20K, investing 15K in Chiatech Password Security
	<br>and gambling the rest. I'm a puzzle dungeon architect. I arrange torches, keys, dynamite and boulders
	<br>to squash some poor cave frog hunting for gems. My theme song slogs around the empty living room, woeful.
	<br>I'm a freeloader: I visit all temples and lonely plushies to collect their offerings and sell them for cheap.
	<br>I'm also a Good Samaritan: I donate a Tombola Keyring and Reject Ornate Rainbow Sand to the Money Tree.
	<br>Distant microwave beeps summon me to the kitchen. My sisters and I chat over leftovers and plot to poison
	<br>our aunt. In a red Solo cup we pour Windex, Coke, Lysol, soymilk, pho, bug spray and AquaFresh. We are
	<br>celebrated sous-chefs. We brew the muck with a chopstick, a hygienic, lead slosh with alien-dung aroma and
	<br>the glint of a MEGA RARE item. We leave it on the counter hoping Auntie will gulp it down out of curiosity.
	<br>It's 2 PM now so I visit the Snowager, but it just blasts my pet so I shrug and go shopping in Altador.
	<br>
	<br>Later our dad takes us to Fry's Electronics, a warehouse of DVDs and other items Indiana Jones might hoard.
	<br>Somehow it's also a pyramid. The wallpaper depicts ceremonial rites; pillars of stone and palm trees divide
	<br>the printers and the VCR tapes. Madonna plays overhead. We jerk at the coin machine to try and steal tattoos.
	<br>Back home, we watch our aunt dump our restorative down the sink instead of chugging it. I'm a bit relieved.
	<br>After dinner I sleuth around the Kreludan Mining Corp. looking for secrets. I've already solved one mystery.
	<br>Yesterday I found the Faerieland Hidden Tower and there was my mom, shimmering, in a pink, diaphanous dress.
	<br>She guards the most expensive items in Neopia, and promises to return if I can afford anything she owns.
