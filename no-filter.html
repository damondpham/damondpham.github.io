		<img src="stuff/no-filter/IMG_3138.jpg" alt="'No filter [Smiling emoji with halo]' panel 1. It's a composite of successive screenshots in the editing interface of the iPhone Photos app. This one shows Damon squinting forward but off-camera, holding a mic to his mouth. The layers of editing UI create an array of icons above and below his face. The main color in the picture is tan.">
		<img src="stuff/no-filter/IMG_3316.PNG" alt="'No filter [Smiling emoji with halo]' panel 2. It's a picture of the 'Recents' page on the iPhone Photos app. All the recent pictures are of the image editing tool, editing an image of the image editing tool... you get the idea. The composite picture has many vertical lines.">
		<img src="stuff/no-filter/IMG_3151.jpg" alt="'No filter [Smiling emoji with halo]' panel 3. It's like panel 1, but showing a picture of a purple-blue night sky with fireworks coming from a skyscraper instead. The photo and some of the UI elements are clearly upside-down.">
		<img src="stuff/no-filter/IMG_3248.PNG" alt="'No filter [Smiling emoji with halo]' panel 4. It's a screenshot of the 'Albums' page in Photos showing a mix of photos similar to those of panels 1 and 3. One larger photo is centered, and then many fractal-like photos are in the background. there's tan & purple, and then the grey and black of the iPhone interface. ">
		<img src="stuff/no-filter/IMG_3342.PNG" alt="'No filter [Smiling emoji with halo]' panel 5. This one is like panel 2. It's a screenshot of successive screenshots of the image adjustment tool on the iPhone, set to edit sharpness. The UI layers from the top and bottom tunnel inward, recursively and seemingly infinitely; altogether the UI layers form an hourglass shape.">
